Current Server Map

Based on configurations under config/deploy

Roles/processes run in servers:

production
  MySQL
  ElastichSearch

web3
  Nginx as load balancer that distributes to Rails servers (web3, etc.)

web3, web4, web5
  Rails puma

cache_server
  Redis memory cache

staging
  Database accesses that of production
  Nginx
  Rails puma - in staging environment
  occasional tasks to export data

backend_server
  Delayed jobs - database-saved scheduled background tasks
  scheduled cron jobs


#######################################
Source code management, github

------------------------------
Base deployment using capistrano

  cap web3 deploy
  cap web3 puma:restart

  Repeat for:
    web3, web4, web5, backend

where web3 config files are located at config/deploy folder.  File of that name gets run "cap xxx deploy"

------------------------------
If to move to specific commit of changes in GIT branch, get the SHA code of commit:
  git checkout 757c47d4

  and if to re-deploy at this point of code changes, make another branch of master
    git checkout -b master_at_757c47d4
    git push origin master_at_757c47d4

    and deploy using BRANCH environment var
      BRANCH=master_at_757c47d4 cap web3 deploy

Server Commands

--------------------------------------
Running puma, the Rails server

as deploy user of the server
at folder /var/www/shoppn_spree/current, start by:

  bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb --daemon

If puma has been running without code change, might be able to restart gracefully:

  bundle exec pumactl -P shared/pids/pumaproduction.pid restart

  staging would have "pumastaging.pid" instead.

If still server process still not dead, have to use system level kill:

  ps ax | grep puma

  may come with output:
    5444 ?        Sl   181:03 puma 4.3.10 (tcp://0.0.0.0:8000,unix:///var/www/shoppn_spree/releases/20220602174330/shared/sockets/puma.sock) [20220602174330]
  13029 pts/0    S+     0:00 grep puma

  where "5444" is the process ID, so run this to kill

    kill -s QUIT 5444

--------------------------------------
Running delayed_jobs

as deploy user of server

  bin/delayed_job start

but if server has the resources to run multiple threads
  bin/delayed_job -n 2 start

run specific named queues
  bin/delayed_job -queues=follow_up_email,stats start

To stop
  bin/delayed_job stop
  but sometimes kill call might be needed to stop: kill -s SIGTERM 333
    after "ps ax | grep delay" to find which delayed_job proccesses 

--------------------------------------
Running ElastichSearch

library and data at folder like: /var/www/elasticsearch-7.5.0/
Run by

as deploy user of server

  bin/elasticsearch -d

To incrementally push each available product to search dindex, run

  bundle exec rake es:reindex_products

To totally rebuild products index from scratch (delete index, command ElastichSearch to import all)

  bundle exec rake es:rebuild_products_index

There is one script to run redundant checks to ensure each record changed since some time,
run periodically like below.  This would be tedious task like rebuild_products_index if no time parameter

  START_TIME_IN_RUBY="25.hours.ago" bundle exec rake es:sync_indices

See actual RoR codes called in lib/tasks/es.rake


--------------------------------------
Running MySQL

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/starting-and-stopping-mysql-server

as root user of the server:

  sudo service mysqld start

--------------------------------------
Running Redis

https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/

  cd /var/www/redis-stable/src
  redis-server /var/www/redis-stable/redis.conf

--------------------------------------
Running minIO

minio server --console-address :9001 /data

or wherever to keep files saved instead of "/data"

Create buckets for necessary environments
ioffer-assets for production, staging
ioffer-assets-#{Rails.env}

Create access key for production, staging
and another one w/ restricting Access Policy like:

{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
  {
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": [
    "s3:DeleteObject",
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:GetObjectAttributes",
    "s3:GetBucketLocation"
   ],
   "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::ioffer-assets-development/*", "arn:aws:s3:::ioffer-assets-test/*"
   ]
  },
  {
   "Effect": "Deny",
   "Action": [
    "s3:DeleteObject",
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:PutObject"
   ],
   "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::ioffer-assets/*"
   ]
  }
 ]
}

Server Access

Mainly needed:
* ssh public key, as such those set within config/deploy/production.rb

--------------------------------------
On Linux or Mac computer, can setup saved settings for easier server access

Login into server's terminal with ssh key (ask to for share):
  ssh shoppn_web3

with config in ~/.ssh/config
